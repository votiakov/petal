# Admin

The admin interface is generated through [Kaffy](https://aesmail.github.io/kaffy/).
You can find extensive documentation on the Kaffy site regarding how to use and
customize your admin interface.

Legendary specific notes:

- The configuration for Kaffy in your Legendary app is located in config/admin.exs.
- Many of the built-in schemas provide admin modules. You shouldn't generally
need to change these, but you may want to do so if you are changing built-in schema modules.
